## Insights

The goal of this project was to make a standalone 2D collision detetion system that could be easily used in
other projects. You can check out the more information about this system here (Includes documentation):

## Requirements

The following requirements have been fully completed.

Your Assessment task is to design, develop and document a 2D collision detection sub-system for a game engine. You must use the architectural design principles discussed in the module, specifically the collision detection sub-system must demonstrate decoupling, modularity and abstraction. Therefore your code base must be highly reusable in different contexts.

The collision system must be able to handle both rectangles and circles and provide a mechanism by which collision data can be passed on to external game logic. Collisions must be indicated by some means in the world e.g. changing colour or direction of movement or some other effect.

The task consists of two phases, a design phase which will also be your formative assessment in which you will demonstrate a clear design for your software sub-system using one of the design methodologies discussed in the module, and an implementation phase where you will demonstrate your design in a simple game environment. Your design should be clearly documented and include your justifications for the methodology used.

Your final code base must also be clearly documented such that any third parties are able to use it with the minimum amount of difficulty. You do not need to document the game world, just the collision detection sub-system.

The game world should be very simple (you will not be graded on the game itself), simple coloured rectangles and circles moving around in a small space is fine. Use SDL for the game environment and keep it simple.
